                        <p>
                            This post is about a Tableau dashboard that can be viewed <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andrew.lozovoy/viz/BaseballHallofFameVoting/InfoPage">here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've know about the idea web scraping for years, but I had never done it myself.
                            It was time for that to change!
                            As a baseball fan, I knew that baseball-reference.com was the go to site for all things baseball data.
                            I wanted to look at baseball data in a new lens.
                            There are countless professionals working to create advanced stats and trying to squeeze every ounce out of the analytics, but I wanted to find something new.
                            I found the Hall of Fame voting pages.
                            For each year, they show a table of the players who were on the Hall of Fame ballot that year, and the voting results.
                            I wanted to explore if voting trajectories meant anything about the quality of player.
                            THIS SECTION NEEDS IMPROVING
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Building a Web Scraper</h2>
                        <p>
                            I used the Python library Beautiful Soup to scrape the Baseball Reference website.
                            It took quite a while to understand the structure of the HTML and parse out the data into a DataFrame.
                            It wasn't very difficult, but it was a time consuming and tedious task.
                            Once I had data from a single page, it was easy to loop through all of the voting years since the 1930s.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            I needed to clean several columns of data.
                            For example, "Year on Ballot" was listed as a string: "1st", "2nd", "3rd", etc.
                            I transformed this into an integer so that I would be able to plot it in Tableau.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each player's career statistics are shown for each year they were on the ballot.
                            This created lots of duplicate data. I decided to clean this up and split the data into two separate DataFrames.
                            This first contained each player on at least one ballot and their career statistics.
                            The second had each player listed for each year they were on the ballot, and the results of that vote.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I then saved the DataFrames asÂ .csv files to open in Tableau.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Tableau</h2>
                        <p>
                            I used a relationship in Tableau to connect the two tables, and  then created a plot showing voting percentages by year.
                            This gave me what I was looking for. Each line was a player and it was easy to see their voting trajectories.
                            I used color to show a player's career WAR. This stands for Wins Above Replacement and reduces a players value to a single number.
                            It certainly doesn't capture everything about a player, but it provides an easy way to see where public perception (voting) agrees or disagrees with statistical value (WAR).
                            Some notable players are Barry Bonds and Roger Clements who have very high WAR values but never reached the 70% voting mark due to their connections with steroids.
                            We also see players like Bruce Sutter who was voted in despite a low career WAR of only 24.0.
                            That's not to say he isn't worthy, but it is interesting LINK
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I decided to recreate the same dashboard, but use "Year on Ballot" as the x-axis rather than year.
                            This provides a better comparison of all the voting trajectories
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Insights and Conclusions</h2>
                        <p>
                            Lee Smith has the highest first year voting (42.3%) to not make the Hall of Fame.
                            Many HOF players started with a lower percentage, but For players who clear this benchmark in their first voting year, it is a near certainty that they will reach 70% eventually.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The average HOFer players just over 19 seasons in their career.
                            This is much higher than the league average, and stands to show how important both peak and longevity are to HOF voters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I noticed a few values for which it appears the Baseball Reference data is erroneous.
                            I opted not to clean this up since I don't have any way to verify, and arbitrary cleaning based on my impressions of the data is not a very scientific method to follow.
                            It is better to just show all the data than for it to be arbitrary redacted.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Takeaways</h2>
                        <p>
                            As a project to build a web scraper, this project was very successful.
                            I now have another tool for pulling data into my projects and I can't wait to find new opportunities use it again.
